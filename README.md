# quizzler-app-API_PRACTICE
This quiz is made for API calling practice. 
In which we can create our own API using the open trivia database for what type of questions user wants to play with. 
It also checks the knowledge of handling classes. 
Please make sure to change the parameters according to the type of API used.
